# openai_conversation

Generate a conversation from the OpenAI service given a prompt text.

Requires the OpenAI API key to be stored in a text file named `api.key`

This example will generate a line of text to the console.

    $ ./chat.sh 'The following is said by a sirius cybernetics corporation device to a human user'
    "I'm sorry to tell you this, but you are the product of lower primates who, over the course of millions of years, have evolved into the human beings that you are today."
    
The usefulness of this script is that it provides an easy way of querying the OpenAI API and downloading the resulting response as a line of text.
